# Changelog

Morph Studio by R Cubed. Releases are git tags (`v0.2.0b1`); `run_studio --update` switches a clone to the newest
one. Versions follow [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/): `b1` is a beta.

## 0.2.0b1 (beta, not yet tagged)

The first tagged release. Generated designs, wiring and firmware are not bench-validated.

### Features (beta)

The feature teams add their entries here before the tag:

- _A new robot from a one-line request, with follow-up questions._
- _Import a robot or a part: URDF, MJCF, meshes, BOM._
- _Show Morph the job: video and photo uploads._
- SubQ Snap: an optional SubQ key (Keys, `SUBQ_API_KEY`) for quick yes/no and multiple-choice decisions, shown as
  "SubQ Snap (AI)". It is only called with your key and network lookups on, retries once, switches itself off for a
  refused or out-of-credit key, caches answers (never requests or photos) for 7 days, and every use has an offline
  fallback. `morph doctor` checks it; `morph subq "<text>"` tries a key by hand.
- _Teams preview: GitHub for physical things._
- _World mode (beta)._

### Studio

- Each browser tab works on its own project: the project menu (it always opens now, even with one project) switches
  that tab only and puts `?project=` in its address, so other tabs and other people stay where they are.
- Chat and parameter edits wait their turn in a queue per project instead of being dropped while a build runs; the
  message says where it waits. An edit to a setting that changed after you asked is not applied over it: the chat
  asks whether to apply it to the newest revision or drop it. One build runs at a time across projects.
- Each project keeps its chat, so it is still there after switching projects or restarting.
- New projects, forks and deletes through `/api/projects` (deleted projects move to `projects/.trash/`).
  **Reset demo** only touches the demo robots (egg-picker and so101), never projects you made.
- Revisions sort by number (r1000 after r999) and a number is never reused; ledger times are UTC.
- Only changes to pipeline code rebuild the demo robots at the next start.

### Install and updates

- Launchers find Python 3.10 to 3.14 and say what to install when there is none (Python 3.15 is too new for now).
  They rebuild a broken `.venv`, show pip's progress on the first install, and skip pip on later launches.
- Launchers no longer pull `main` on every start. `run_studio --update` switches a git clone to the newest release
  tag; without it, the launchers never run git, and after the first install they start offline.
- `constraints.txt` pins tested versions with wheels for Python 3.10 to 3.14 on Windows x64, macOS 12+ on Apple
  silicon and Linux x64.
- One version number, in `morph/__init__.py`. The package metadata now has the licence, project links, supported
  Pythons and the extras `video`, `cad`, `xacro` and `dev`.
- A wheel now carries the SO-101 robot, Darwin's cached answers and the licences, and keeps `.env` out of
  site-packages. Running from the git folder is unchanged.
- CI on Windows, macOS and Linux with Python 3.10 to 3.14, a lint job, and a check that the installed wheel builds
  both demo robots.
- New docs: [INSTALL](docs/INSTALL.md), [PRIVACY](docs/PRIVACY.md), [SECURITY](SECURITY.md),
  [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md), a [release checklist](docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md). Internal planning
  docs moved to `docs/internal/`.

### Privacy

- The Studio page loads nothing from other sites: Inter and JetBrains Mono ship with Morph instead of coming from
  Google Fonts.
- Keewano build events and grip-force calibration are opt-in. Calibration never uses synthetic or thin data, and the
  UI says that the R Cubed demo history is seeded, not measured.
- New switches under Keys, Privacy and network; `MORPH_OFFLINE=1` turns every network call off.
- Board exports no longer carry Morph's licence; `morph kicad --license` adds one when you choose.

### Security

- The server keeps every file request inside the open project, checks project and robot names before creating
  anything, caps and checks request bodies, bounds its event queues and sends security headers with a content
  security policy.
- `arm.source` names a robot in a known folder; URDF meshes stay inside the robot's folder.
- `.env` is written readable by your user only. Chat can't change the project name or the robot source, and a chat
  message that looks like an API key is refused.

### Fixes

- A failed stage stays failed instead of being reused as feasible by a later edit; required output files are
  checked; fallback CAD is labelled preview-only.
- SO-101 gripper firmware uses radians.
- Changing the SO-101's electronics in a fresh process no longer fails (`KeyError: 'sts3215_7v4'`).
- The CLI exits non-zero when a build fails, prints safely on Windows consoles, and `morph doctor` shows the version
  and git commit.
- Export a revision as a ZIP with a manifest of what completed. Keys, settings, chat and the ledger are never included.
